- Relationship we have with devices now is overpowered by information density that people have to contend with on a daily basis
- *Humane*: restoring balance, devices shouldn't be burden
- Devices draw you in with superhuman capabilities: you tend to lose sight of immediate surroundings
- We don't have a fantastic relationship with *things*
- Devices don't make you feel good
- Next shift in tech will be lead by AI, ML, CV (computer vision)
- Intelligence age will have equally big impact
- AI has ability to augment things, simplify mundane work through automation
- AI has potential to be greatest gift to all of humanity
