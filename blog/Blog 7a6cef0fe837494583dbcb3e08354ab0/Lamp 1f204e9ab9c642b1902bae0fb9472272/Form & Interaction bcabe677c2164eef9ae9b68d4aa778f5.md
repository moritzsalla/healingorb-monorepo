## Ambient Interfaces on the market

## IKEA Lamps

I found that IKEA lamps are simple enough to be a suitable encasing, without me having to create one myself. Although they offer interesting shapes, I stuck with the iconic round design, since it can easily house my Raspberry Pi including a SenseHat.

## Ambient Orb

> Information just a glance away. The Ambient Orb is a device that slowly transitions between thousands of colours to show changes in the weather, the health of your stock portfolio, or if your boss or friend is on instant messenger. It is a simple wireless object that unobtrusively presents information. — Amazon Description, The Orb

## Theremin

A work I did for Phoenix's module. It involved LED strips in silicone spheres, similar to the colourful torch controllers Playstation used to make. I used Christmas Baubles to create the structure, dipped it into silicone and dried it in the oven — this gave the interface a tangible, uncanny and grippy texture.

## Alternative to the SenseHat: using a Philips hue light

### Speed of interaction

- Dictated between refresh rate / easing speed
- Can throw security error if network is being jammed
- Firing too many requests at a given time will make sense hat flicker, as some requests become delayed
- Comparing old to new values, only sending request upon change
- The lamp could flicker once the absolute maximum is reached

[Form%20&%20Interaction%20bcabe677c2164eef9ae9b68d4aa778f5/IMG_2096.mov](Form%20&%20Interaction%20bcabe677c2164eef9ae9b68d4aa778f5/IMG_2096.mov)

Very slow ease - sensehat steps become visible
