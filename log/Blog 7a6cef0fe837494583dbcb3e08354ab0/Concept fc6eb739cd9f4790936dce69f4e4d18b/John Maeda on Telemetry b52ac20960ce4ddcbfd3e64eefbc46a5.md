# John Maeda on Telemetry

Part of the chapter "machines can be instrumented" in the book "How to Speak Machine" by John Maeda. In the book, Maeda shares a broad thoughts on technology at large. He himself calls his book an introduction to computational thinking.

> The word "telemetry" was coined in nineteenth-century France, back when telecommunications technology was first emerging. It described the use of an electrical apparatus that transmitted the snow depth from Mont Blanc, this highest mountain in the alps, to Paris.

Maeda highlights that this is not an exclusively tech thing - it can be just as analog. He reasons that his parents used a curtain made from iron bells in his parents tofu shop would communicate an incoming customer.

Telemetry replaces a person with a sensor, removing the need for manual gathering of data. Data would automatically be transmitted to the home base, if within reach. 

The internet, on the other hand, communicated information two-way, which Maeda thinks is an important distinction to make.

> Two–way communication between two faraway points is subject to errors that will happen from time to time because there's always some kind of imperfection in the system…

- A handshake is when two communicating computers acknowledge each other.
- When connecting the computer to the internet, it has access to another data set, as opposed to key presses and mouse clicks
- Communicating with the manufacturer is an important capability to have, according to Maeda
