# Training

Research into training an own machine learning model on colab and CCI computers. I ended up using pertained models, as this better suited my purpose.

## Plausibility

I spoke to Vitek, an old teacher, about the plausibility to accurately train a model myself. These are my notes from our conversation.

### Colab

**Colab** limits might be too little time to train

### Google / Amazon AWS

Student access cloud solutions by **Google or by Amazon AWS** ~50 bucks of free compute credits. hard to setup and handle. 

### CCI

Progressive GAN should be trainable on windows. Sponsor you some credits for compute on cloud services (again AWS or Google) → Mick.

### Alternative: Latent Space

Instead searching through latent spaces. custom image dataset embedded into it's space with a technique from the paper Img2StyleGAN. 

## Test

In order to get a general hang of training and setting up a suitable environment, I have created a small side project. This has helped me use Colab and CCI computers remotely, should I want to do so later. 

- **CCI** **remote** **computers** do not have admin rights – installing dependencies is often impossible.
- **Colab** is risky as VMs can shut down for no reason, the window cannot be left and larger models will severely slow down the GUI.

## Datasets

Kaggle seems to be the best place to find filtered datasets.
