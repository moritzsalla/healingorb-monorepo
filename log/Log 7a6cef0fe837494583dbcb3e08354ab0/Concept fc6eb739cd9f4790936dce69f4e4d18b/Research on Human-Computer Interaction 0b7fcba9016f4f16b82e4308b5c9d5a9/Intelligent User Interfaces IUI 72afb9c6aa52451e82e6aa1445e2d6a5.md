IUI lies in between HCI and applied machine learning.

### Some scattered notes I have been taking about IUI's, mostly from internet sources

[Intelligent user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_user_interface)

> An intelligent user interface (Intelligent UI, IUI, or sometimes Interface Agent) is a user interface (UI) that involves some aspect of artificial intelligence (AI or computational intelligence). There are many modern examples of IUIs, the most famous (or infamous) being the Microsoft Office Assistant, whose most recognizable agentive representation was called "**Clippy**".

> Generally, an IUI involves the computer-side having sophisticated knowledge of the domain and/or a model of the user. These allow the interface to better understand the user's needs and personalize or guide the interaction.

### Good in-depth introduction to intelligent user interfaces by Wolfgang Wahlster, German computer scientist:

[](http://www.wolfgang-wahlster.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Introduction_to_intelligent_User_Interfaces.pdf)

> The explosion of available materials on corporate, national, and global information networks is driving the need for more effective, efficient, and natural inter- faces to support access to information, applications, and people. This is exacerbated by the **increasing complexity of systems, the shrinking of task time lines, and the need to reduce the cost of application and interface development**. Fortunately, the basic infrastructure for advanced multimedia user interfaces is rapidly appearing or already available. In addition to traditional public telephone networks, cable, fiber-optic, wireless and satellite communications are rapidly evolving with the aim of serving many simultaneous users through a great variety of multimedia communications (e.g., video, audio, text, data). **Rapidly advancing micro- processor and storage capabilities, coupled with multi- media input and output devices integrated into work-stations and portable machines, provide a dizzying array of potential for personal and personalized multi- media interaction.**

Interface technology has advanced from initial command line interfaces to the established use of direct manipulation or WIMP (windows, icons, menus, and pointing) interfaces in nearly all applications.

The next generation of interfaces, often called "intelligent," will provide a number of additional benefits to users, including adaptivity, con- text sensitivity, and task assistance. As with traditional interfaces, principled intelligent interfaces should be learnable, usable, and transparent.

In part stimulated by attempts to pass the Turing test, a number of initial efforts attempted to literally simulate conversation with computers using pattern matching to select possible responses from a conversational database (e.g., McCarthy's ADVICE, Weizenbaum's ELIZA, Colby's PARRY)

### Is *the weather thingy* an intelligent user interface? It curates it's experience by reacting to it's environment.

> **Intelligent user interfaces have been proposed as a means to overcome some of the problems that direct manipulation interfaces cannot handle, such as: information overflow problems; providing help on how to use complex systems; or real-time cognitive overload problems.** Intelligent user interfaces are also being proposed as a means to make systems individualised or personalised, thereby increasing the systemâ€™s flexibility and appeal. Unfortunately, there are a number of problems not yet solved that prevent us from creating good intelligent user interface applications. We do not have efficient methods for developing them. There are demands on better usability principles for them. We need a better understanding of the possible ways the interface can utilise intelligence to improve the interaction. Finally, we need to design better tools that will enable an intelligent system to survive the full life cycle of a system (including updates of the database, system support, etc.). We define these problems further and point out some possible solutions.

## Expert Systems

> In artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert.[1] Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as ifâ€“then rules rather than through conventional procedural code

### Outline of HCI

[Outline of human-computer interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_humanâ€“computer_interaction#Related_fields)

**Process-centered design** (PCD) is a design methodology, which proposes a business centric approach for designing user interfaces. Because of the multi-stage business analysis steps involved right from the beginning of the PCD life cycle, it is believed to achieve the highest levels of business-IT alignment that is possible through UI.

**Sonic interaction design** is the study and exploitation of sound as one of the principal channels conveying information, meaning, and aesthetic/emotional qualities in interactive contexts.[1][2] Sonic interaction design is at the intersection of interaction design and sound and music computing.

**Phenomenology**, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on and study of the structures of consciousness and the phenomena that appear in acts of consciousness. Phenomenology can be clearly differentiated from the Cartesian method of analysis which sees the world as objects, sets of objects, and objects acting and reacting upon one another.
