## Alternative to the SenseHat: using a Philips hue light

### Speed of interaction

- Dictated between refresh rate / easing speed
- Can throw security error if network is being jammed
- Firing too many requests at a given time will make sense hat flicker, as some requests become delayed
- Comparing old to new values, only sending request upon change
- The lamp could flicker once the absolute maximum is reached

Quick ease

Slow ease

Very slow ease - sensehat steps become visible
