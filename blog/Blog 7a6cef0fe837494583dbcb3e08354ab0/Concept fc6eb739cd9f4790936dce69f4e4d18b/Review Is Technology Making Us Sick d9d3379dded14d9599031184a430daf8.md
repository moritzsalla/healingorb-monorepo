I picked this book up in Tate Britain. Its authors, Ian Douglas, is a journalist who has worked for the Telegraph, the New York Times, the British Library, and others. He has written widely on science, technology and health. The book is edited by Matthew Tailor, Chief Executive of the RSA.

> We are, uniquely, the ape that makes complex tools and uses them to solve its problems. We call those tools technology.

- Earlier civilisations often harmed themselves through the use of new technology
- The invention of agriculture caused Neolithic people to become anaemic, osteoporotic, deficient in zinc, calcium, vitamins D, B12 and A; and smaller in stature.
- Civilisations might not have identified new technologies as harmful

> The direct use of machinery has always caused injury (…) our love affair with shiny new things has been too strong to put them aside

- Newest paradigm shift: algorithms designed to keep us engaged filter the world we see
- Mental health has been stable for adults. Emotional disorders among children have increased more than 40% since 2004.
- *Memex:* interface in which users would scan their notes and important documents into desk

- Harvard researchers: third of population will experience anxiety
- Depression, dysregulated mood, aggression, fatigue and difficulty concentrating are reported by sufferers in reaction to technology

> Cutting-edge inventions have often provoked a fearful reaction

### Anxiety

In clinical sense, includes panic attacks, debilitating phobias ans sense of overwhelming need to escape. Pulse rises, muscles tense, person becomes vigilant. 

### Dysregulated Mood

Mood swings out of control of subject. Includes anger and outbursts of temper. If persistent, classified as clinical disorder.

### Intuition

Tendency to seek information that accords with existing beliefs. To disregard everything else: confirmation bias.

> All technology is political, (Chellis Gelndinning) claimed, and creates social structures around itself that aid the preservation of the technology, rather than benefit the users

- AI is increasingly used to make decisions that impact welfare of individuals
- Brains have slowly evolved over 2,000 years, having to negotiate technology from the past 200 years
- Change needs to be in transparency of technology, not in its nature

> New technology is unlikely to prove itself

> Our social lives exist in places we cannot relax

- Physically demanding workspaces in Europe, the USA and much of Asia are now strongly regulated
- Mental health enjoys few regulations
- There is no impetus from government for risk assessments when new technology comes along
- Academic rather than industrial pursuit
- Root cause of stress: always on, never done
- Integrators & segmentors
- Sleep is integral for healthy lifestyle. Technology can disrupt it.
- Causes eye strain, vocal loss, uneasiness, muscosceletal damage, hearing impairment, bowel problems in call center workers
- Blue light disrupts natural sleep cycle. Reduces Melatonin, making it harder to sleep, despite feeling tired.
- Effect of technology precedes screen time: worker works, commutes, and does little exercise is at higher risk of illness

> Even before our technology reaches us, it has been the sauce of sickness

> But look closer at the evidence and the phrase "screen time" becomes problematic. What is a child doing when they are looking at a screen? Are they playing a game? What kind of game? Are they reading a book on an e-reader or are they absorbed in a series of rapid-cutting cartoons and adverts?

- Survey found moderate use of tech is not associated with mental problems, and that there are advantages to well-being

> It is more useful to look at what exactly what a person is doing, rather than the device they are going it on.

- Technology learns from users through data collection but researchers choose which groups to take notice of

> The Hook Model has four phases: trigger, action, variable reward and investment

- Studies have found increased incidences of depression, anxiety, social isolation, easting disorders, compulsive disorders, gambling dependency and suicide all linked to habit forming products
- Gaming is not used in traditional way of gambling
- Sales of violent games far outstrip those of other genres

> A habit forming method can be hugely beneficial. When we use it to encourage exercise, healthy eating, anger management or abstention from drugs or nicotine it can be life saving. Problems arise when the habit former's goal is not a healthy one — Nir Eyal, Hooked

- Technology is often a commercial product

> Many of the dangers to our health caused by personal technology could be avoided if there was greater awareness of them, but the companies that make headsets and apps are reluctant to acknowledge the dangers for fear of losing users

- Characteristics that cause a positive reaction in some users can lead to anxiety and depression in others
- "Digital Detox"
- Traffic light system in terms of service. Users can become more aware and exercise some form of judgement.

> You can be online, you can be offline, as long as you know where you are

> More screen-time has been linked with shorter sleep duration, decreased sleep efficiency, and longer sleep onset delay. When using any screen before bedtime, the blue light emitted disrupts the body's natural melatonin hormone production
