# Notes on AI UI keynote by Chris Minnick

My first encounter with the world of ML + AI. In hindsight, this keynote appears more apocalyptic than at first. It sparked my interest yet isn't very suitable to base any claims on.

This is one of the only videos on youtube about Intelligent user interfaces. Minnick appears to be a developer and educator — I trust WeAreDevelopers that he has something to say about the topic.

## User Interface

User and computer interact by:

- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
- **Natural User Interface (NUI)**
- ***Gesture* *Driven***

Interested primarily in GUIs & gesture driven interfaces

## Invisible UI

**Use of AI to reduce friction in interaction.**

- Computer doing things without user specifically asking for them
- Conversational AI: talking to computer like talking to person

Examples of invisible UI:

- Zero UI
- No UI

### Potential use cases

- Elevator plays favourite song
- Homekit knows which lights it needs to turn on
- Taxi plays favourite song

## Conversational AI

Not good enough to maintain conversation

- Siri
- Alexa
- Google Allo
- Operator
- Facebook Messenger

Evolving interfaces = Evolution

## Potential Hazzards

- Self improving AI systems must be strictly regulated
- Results are difficult to regulate

Evolving interfaces optimise **quality & quantity** of interaction
