# Human-centred ML

A guideline for UXers to design AI whilst staying grounded in human needs. The term seems to originates from US  universities. 

> Machine learning (ML)-based AI systems trained with incomplete or distorted data (i.e., their "worldview") can lead to biased "thinking," which may in turn magnify prejudice and inequality, spread rumors and fake news.

AI is to enhance humans rather than replace them
