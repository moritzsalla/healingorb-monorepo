# Improving digital mental health with smart furniture

I am preoccupied with human existence in the digital realm. The information age has disrupted our lives—it has completely overwhelmed us to the point of malfunction. I believe that we need non–intrinsic interfaces and a new stance toward data consumption to simplify our lives.

Many of the issues listed in the UN brief are not new, nor are they specific to COVID-19. The pandemic hasn't created problems; it amplified existing ones. As physical contact is limited and the economy grapples with its survival, we have been digitized by brute force, at unprecedented speeds. Harmful amounts of exposure to digital devices have been linked to sleep deprivation and depression, increased risk of obesity, and upset eating habits. Digitalization comes at a cost to our wellbeing.

### The pandemic hasn’t created problems; it amplified existing ones.
Yet specifically mental health is an overlooked symptom of Coronavirus.

As physical contact is limited and the economy grapples with its survival, we have been digitized by brute force, at unprecedented speeds.
When our social contacts vanish, we increasingly seek leisure, work and social contact online, our lives become virtual.

### Excessive digital media use has been linked to various health risks, including:

- Depression
- Anxiety
- Obesity
- Sleeping disorder
- Upset eating habits
- Impact on social behavior
- Impeded brain development in young children

### Conventional screen time apps are a good initiative but they have various problems:

1. They only visualise duration and provide little insight into what kind of content the user is exposed to
2. They are digital, committing to screen time
3. They are easily ignored
4. They disrupt our digital experience

# Designing smart furniture that visualizes personal online exposure provides mental health feedback as well as an incentive to have a healthy lifestyle.

### The smart furniture I envision has two parts:
① Software that runs in the background of your computer and collects usage data
② A wireless smart device that visualises said data in meaningful ways

# ① Software

### Software running background tasks to get insight into a users online exposure.

E.g. a chrome extension that accesses screen time and site content. Machine learning models could classify scraped images and text, providing more in-depth understanding into the content.

# ② Smart Furniture

## A Raspberry Pi embedded in a physical enclosure, always connected wirelessly

This means it is easy to wirelessly communicate with via the internet, from multiple devices.
