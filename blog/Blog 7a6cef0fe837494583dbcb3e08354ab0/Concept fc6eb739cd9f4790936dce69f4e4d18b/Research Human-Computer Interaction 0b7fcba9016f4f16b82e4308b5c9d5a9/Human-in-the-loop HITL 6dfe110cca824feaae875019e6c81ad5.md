Leveraging the power of ML and human collaboration. Humans are directly involved in training, tuning and testing.

> Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid; humans are incredibly slow, inaccurate and brilliant; together they are powerful beyond imagination

In practice, this would mean to use a human crowd to correct inaccuracies within machine predictions, yielding higher quality results.

BigGAN used a large, virtual crowd to curate its data. Is this an example of HITL?

Human interaction with machine learning systems to improve human performance, machine performance, or both

HITL = **supervised machine learning + active learning**

When is this useful?

- No margin of error can be tollerated
- Class imbalances: the desired outcome is niche and cannot be determined with high confidence
- Little data. Ex. a business in its early stages.
