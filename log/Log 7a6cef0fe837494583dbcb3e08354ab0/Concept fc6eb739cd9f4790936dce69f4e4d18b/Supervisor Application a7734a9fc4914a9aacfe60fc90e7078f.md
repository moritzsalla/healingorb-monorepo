# Supervisor Application

I want to look into how we can use **machine learning to create new or change existing interfaces** to make them more **meaningful and accessible.**

I’ve been looking into **generative design** (using machine learning to create highly iterative design outcomes) and how it ends up mimicking nature. It’s commonly used in architecture and engineering to create physical objects.

I’m interested if and how this can be **applied to virtual spaces.**

I have an interest in not only exploring it technically but also approaching it in a more thoughtful way. I’d be interested in **weaving some media theory/computer history into it.**

As a side tangent, I want to get deeper into the theories of user experience design, as it is a **systematic approach to studying human behaviour in relation to computer interfaces**

### Revised

- I've been thinking about making an IoT device which helps the user track his/her digital mental health
- Consists of two parts:
    - **Chrome extension** that scrapes website for certain characteristics such as sentiment, political affiliation, filter bubble
    - **Physical device** that supplies feedback/summary about behaviour
- Difference to regular screen time app: uses machine learning to give insight into the content of a session, not duration or category

### Nothing About Us Without Us

Designing for impaired people requires a tight collaboration with them. They should co–design, not only be testers.
