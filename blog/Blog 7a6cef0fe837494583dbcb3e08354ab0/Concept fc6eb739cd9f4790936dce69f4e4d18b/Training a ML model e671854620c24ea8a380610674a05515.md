# Training a ML model

## Colab

**Colab** limits might be too little time to train

## Google / Amazon AWS

Student access cloud solutions by **Google or by Amazon AWS** ~50 bucks of free compute credits. hard to setup and handle. 

## CCI

Progressive GAN should be trainable on windows. Sponsor you some credits for compute on cloud services (again AWS or Google) → Mick.

## Alternative: Latent Space

Instead searching through latent spaces. custom image dataset embedded into it's space with a technique from the paper Img2StyleGAN. 

# Test

In order to get a general hang of training and setting up a suitable environment, I have created a small side project. This has helped me use Colab and CCI computers remotely, should I want to do so later. 

- **CCI** **remote** **computers** do not have admin rights – installing dependencies is often impossible.
- **Colab** is risky as VMs can shut down for no reason, the window cannot be left and larger models will severely slow down the GUI.

## Training on websites

Which data am I analysing? Which data meaningfully says something about mental health? Which data is objectively classifiable?

1. **Fake** **news**
2. **Sentiment**

## Fake News

### Dataset:

[Fake and real news dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

### NLP model:

[NLP using GloVe Embeddings(99.87% Accuracy)](https://www.kaggle.com/madz2000/nlp-using-glove-embeddings-99-87-accuracy/execution)

How do I use the trained model to create a prediction on new input?

How to I port this to tensorflow.js?

## Sentiment Analysis

### Pretrained tensorflow.js example (Text toxtricity):

These are notes derived from a conversation with Vitek about the plausibility of training a GAN myself. I wish to train a model on image datasets of various interfaces (computers, steering wheels, chairs?).

Pix2Pix could be used to draw GUIs

Can I use my own model to ml5?
