# Brainstorm

## Themes of interest

- Nature vs. Computer
- Accessibility through machine learning (VR for the blind)
- Digital to Physical
- Generative/computational/parametric interfaces
- Fluid Interfaces
- Human centred AI products
- Data driven design. Data driven interaction.
- *"Mediating"* interactions between humans and computers
- Fluid design
- "the interface museum / museum of interfaces"

> All works presented take on the notion of a world in transition and the need for humans to change their attitude towards this world. This can be for example towards humanity technology, tradition, nature and/or spirituality.

## Research / Design **Goals**

- Get grasp of field, foundations & references
- Find problem I'd like to fix: digital literacy?
- **Experiment with interfaces & machine learning**
- Look into biomimicry as inspiration?
- **Fix real problem, create realistic solution**
