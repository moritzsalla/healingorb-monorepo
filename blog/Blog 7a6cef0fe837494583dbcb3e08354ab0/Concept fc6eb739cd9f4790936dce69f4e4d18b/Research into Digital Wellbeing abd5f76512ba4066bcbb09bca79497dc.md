- Relationship we have with devices now is overpowered by information density that people have to contend with on a daily basis
- *Humane*: restoring balance, devices shouldn't be burden
- Devices draw you in with superhuman capabilities: you tend to lose sight of immediate surroundings
- We don't have a fantastic relationship with *things*
- Devices don't make you feel good
- Next shift in tech will be lead by AI, ML, CV (computer vision)
- Intelligence age will have equally big impact
- AI has ability to augment things, simplify mundane work through automation
- AI has potential to be greatest gift to all of humanity

**Password unlock**: You know device

**Face unlock**: device recognises you, "like pet"

## Mozilla's Trustworthy AI

In 2018, Mozilla identified the explosion of devices, platforms and products that include AI-enabled technologies as a key opportunity and threat to the health of the internet.

[Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/internet-health/trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/)

- Effects of AI
- Big data
- Targeted marketing

## **Mozilla's Values:**

- **PRIVACY**: Our personal data powers everything from traffic maps to targeted advertising. Trustworthy AI should let people decide how their data is used and what **decisions** are made with it.
- **FAIRNESS**: We’ve seen time and again that **historical bias** can show up in automated decision making. To effectively address discrimination, we need to look closely at the goals and data that fuel our AI.
- **TRUST**: **Algorithms on sites like YouTube often push people towards extreme, misleading content**. **Overhauling these content recommendation systems could go a long way to curbing misinformation.**
- **SAFETY**: Experts have raised the alarm that AI could **increase security risks and cyber crime**. Platform developers will need to create stronger measures to protect our data and personal security.
- **TRANSPARENCY**: Automated decisions can have huge personal impact, yet the reasons for decisions are often opaque. We need breakthroughs in **explainability** and transparency to protect users.

### **MozFest**

MozFest is our annual gathering of educators, activists, technologists, researchers, artists, and young people dedicated to creating a better, healthier internet. Every year, more than 2,000 people from around the world gather to create art, build tools, write code and brainstorm products and policies that put social responsibility and the user first.

## Filter Bubbles

Using adaptive (Machine-learning based) interfaces to to counter intellectual isolation through filter bubbles

> *Machine-learning based technique to **modify newscasts to promote reflection instead of reaction***

- Changing the way we interact with **data**/the internet
- Changing the way we perceive our **virtual environment**
- **Perception**

## Filter bubbles

## Counteragent

***Counteragent* (filter algorithm vs creational algorithm).** Chrom plugin sensorship curation?

## Facebook's emotion study

[Everything We Know About Facebook's Secret Mood Manipulation Experiment](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/)

> Data scientists skewed what almost 700,000 Facebook users saw when they logged into its service. Some people were shown content with a preponderance of happy and positive words; some were shown content analyzed as sadder than average. And when the week was over, these manipulated users were more likely to post either especially positive or negative words themselves.

Injecting content that the user does not find interesting, cannot identify with (negative trend)

[We asked the internet how they'd design AI](https://medium.com/space10/we-asked-the-internet-how-theyd-design-ai-ea70a073a5f)

A subclass of [**information filtering system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_filtering_system) that **seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item**. They are primarily used in commercial applications.

Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas and are most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services like [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix), [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube) and [Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify), product recommenders for services such as [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)), or content recommenders for **social media** platforms such as [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) and [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter). These systems **can operate using a single input**, like music, **or multiple inputs** within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and [online dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_dating). Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services.

- Is it possible to train a recommender system yourself?
- Which data would you train it on? Would this data be scraped?
- Can the browser pose as a continuous input stream for interactive machine learning?

## Questions

- Should everybody have the same search results? Duckduckgo.
- Is exposure to opposing viewpoints enough?
