I first came across this book in Tate Britain, and although it caught my eyes, it took another 4 encounters in various art galleries for me to purchase one. I later realised that the author, Ruben Pater, turns out to be a lecturer at the Royal Academy of Art The Hague, where I studied my undergrad.

The book is wildly entertaining yet pretty grim, concerning the ignorance western design concepts show in regards to the foreign. For my research, I focussed predominantly on the chapters on Color Theory and meaning. My notes are listed as bullet points below.

- The human eye can roughly distinguish between 7.5 and 10 million hues
- About 8% of men and 0.5% of women have some type of colour-blindness
- The two major types of colour-blindness are red–green (Deuteranopia and Protanopia), and green–blue (Tritanopia)
- Color blindness is more common than assumed. Design must be contpous of this.
- To this day, scientists and artists have tried to categorise color into systems
- The industry uses CMYK and RGB
- Mayans and Incas of Mesoamerica had colour categories unknown to the rest of world
- Color systems are not universally recognised. Bellona island in Polynesia has no concept of color.

> The belief that there are universal systems of colour shared by all cultures, is a romantic idea that originated in nineteenth century Western Europe

- Before industrial manufacturing, color was created with natural pigments
- Pricey pigments were a status symbol and have an influence on which colours we connect to wealth (ex. green)
- The Americans food rations dropped over Afghanistan were yellow, but so were their cluster bombs. Many failed to explode on impact. Food rations were changed to pink well into the war.

> How people respond to colour is of great interest to those who work in marketing

- Goethe, Schiller, Gestalt Psychology, The bauhaus and Wassily Kandinsky were important influences on color theory
- Best known psychology test was conducted by Max Lüscher and examined personality based on responses people would give in relation to colored cards
- Disputed, since it is not determinable if people respond to colour of cultural concept of colour
- Undisputed: cooler colours have a calming effect on people. Prisons and hospitals are often painted blue.

> Blue coloured pills work better as depressants, and red colour pills better as stimulants

- Colour meaning changes over time
