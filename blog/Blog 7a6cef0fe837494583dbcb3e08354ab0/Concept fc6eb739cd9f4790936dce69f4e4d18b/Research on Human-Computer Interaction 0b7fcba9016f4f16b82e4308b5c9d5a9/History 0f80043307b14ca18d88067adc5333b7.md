[History of automated adaptive instruction in computer applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_automated_adaptive_instruction_in_computer_applications)

> Within the field of human-computer interaction there has long been interest in developing adaptive automated instruction software to facilitate **learning of application programs**. This software would monitor a computer user's behavior while he or she uses the application program, and then **provide optimized and personalized instruction to help the user become more skilled with the application**.

### SAKI — Gordon Pask and Robin McKinnon-Wood (1956)

> First **adaptive instruction system** to go into commercial production. SAKI taught **keyboard skills** and it optimized the rate by which a trainee keyboard operator learned by making the **difficulty level of the tasks contingent on the learner's performance**. As the learner's performance improved the rate of teaching increased and instructional support was delayed.

### Flexcel — C. Thomas and M. Krogsaeter (1992)

> Adaptable extension to Microsoft Excel. Records and studies the user's command history using Excel and "**analyzes the user's interaction style** and **presents** **adaptation suggestions**." E.x. the program notes when a user repeatedly **fails** to utilize an available shortcut and **reminds** the user about the existence of the shortcut.

### Active Assistant for CAD — S. Bhavnani (1996)

> **Records the history of a CAD user's usage of the program, and monitors for "symptoms of suboptimal and incorrect CAD usage."** Upon discovering such cases, it might provide "textual notification that there is a better way to perform a task executed by the user" or it might provide "graphic remediation" utilizing a tutorial window.

### Office Assistant — Microsoft (1996)

> Provides personalized assistance in the use of Office 97 products. Provides a variety of forms of advice to users, **based on inspection of the user history and comparison** with optimal prototypes. Intrusive and annoying.

Microsoft had read Standford research that claimed people interact with computers like they do with humans. Logical followup: putting faces of people on computers. (**anothropromorphism**)

Pidi? Voice controlled. Music.

Adware / spyware. Onzybuddy? Collected data from kids?

This lead to Siri, Cortana etc.

### Supporting Learning as an Iterative Process — Oppermann & Thomas (1996)

> Users of an application to be learned can acquire usage knowledge iteratively by experience, annotations and individual or cooperative recourses to prior knowledge.

### Organization Wide Learning Project — F. Linton (1999)

> **All of the computer users within an organization run software that keeps track of the Microsoft Office commands they issue**. By pooling and comparing the command histories of different users, OWL can "recommend to each user individual selected Word features that their **peers** have already found useful.

### Context-sensitive Nomadic Information System — Oppermann & Specht (2001)

Supports **learning by adaptive information** about museum exhibits while roaming through a museum.

*User modelling*

### Some reflections

How can ML be used to improve design?

- ML aided creation
    - CAD? GUIs?
    - Alternative interfaces?
- Creation by ML
    - Supervised
    - Unsupervised
- Design continuously redesigns itself based on environmental data
    - Generative design
    - Fluid interfaces

> While today's pervasive digital devices put the world’s information at our fingertips, they do not help us with some of the cognitive skills that are arguably more important to leading a successful life, such as **motivation**, **attention**, **memory**, **creativity**, and **emotion regulation**. Building upon insights from psychology and neuroscience, the Fluid Interfaces group creates systems and interfaces for **cognitive enhancement**. Our designs enhance cognitive skills by **teaching users to exploit and develop the untapped powers of their mind** and by seamlessly supplementing users' natural cognitive abilities. The solutions we design are **compact and wearable to support real-life studies and interventions.**

Can we use ML to build things that continuously refine and redesign themselves to fit current times and user needs?

Would this be something we want? Human design sets precedents. A designer can form user wants and needs. AI has no concept of intent, it can only tell degrees of accuracy.
