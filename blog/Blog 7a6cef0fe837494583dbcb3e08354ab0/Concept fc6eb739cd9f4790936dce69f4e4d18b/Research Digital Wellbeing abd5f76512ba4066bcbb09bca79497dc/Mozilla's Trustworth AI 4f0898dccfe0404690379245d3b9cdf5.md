- Effects of AI
- Big data
- Targeted marketing

## **Mozilla's Values:**

- **PRIVACY**: Our personal data powers everything from traffic maps to targeted advertising. Trustworthy AI should let people decide how their data is used and what **decisions** are made with it.
- **FAIRNESS**: Weâ€™ve seen time and again that **historical bias** can show up in automated decision making. To effectively address discrimination, we need to look closely at the goals and data that fuel our AI.
- **TRUST**: **Algorithms on sites like YouTube often push people towards extreme, misleading content**. **Overhauling these content recommendation systems could go a long way to curbing misinformation.**
- **SAFETY**: Experts have raised the alarm that AI could **increase security risks and cyber crime**. Platform developers will need to create stronger measures to protect our data and personal security.
- **TRANSPARENCY**: Automated decisions can have huge personal impact, yet the reasons for decisions are often opaque. We need breakthroughs in **explainability** and transparency to protect users.
