# Filter Bubbles

Using adaptive (Machine-learning based) interfaces to to counter intellectual isolation through filter bubbles

[Everything We Know About Facebook's Secret Mood Manipulation Experiment](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/)

> Data scientists skewed what almost 700,000 Facebook users saw when they logged into its service. Some people were shown content with a preponderance of happy and positive words; some were shown content analyzed as sadder than average. And when the week was over, these manipulated users were more likely to post either especially positive or negative words themselves.

Injecting content that the user does not find interesting, cannot identify with (negative trend)

A subclass of [**information filtering system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_filtering_system) that **seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item**. They are primarily used in commercial applications.

Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas and are most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services like [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix), [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube) and [Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify), product recommenders for services such as [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)), or content recommenders for **social media** platforms such as [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) and [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter). These systems **can operate using a single input**, like music, **or multiple inputs** within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and [online dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_dating). Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services.

- Is it possible to train a recommender system yourself?
- Which data would you train it on? Would this data be scraped?
- Can the browser pose as a continuous input stream for interactive machine learning?

## Questions

- Should everybody have the same search results? Duckduckgo.
- Is exposure to opposing viewpoints enough?
