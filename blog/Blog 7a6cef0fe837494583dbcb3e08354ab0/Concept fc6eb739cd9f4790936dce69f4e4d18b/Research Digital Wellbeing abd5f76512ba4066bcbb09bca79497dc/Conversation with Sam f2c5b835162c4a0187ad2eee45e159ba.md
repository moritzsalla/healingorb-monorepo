# Conversation with Sam

Sam is a friend who is studying psychology in Amsterdam. I asked him if he had some specific insights concerning digital wellbeing, and what he felt was the biggest threat to said. The following quotes are translated from dutch using google translate.

> Hi Sam!

Moritz here. How is it going?

I am currently working on a project dealing with the psychological effects of the internet. Do you know good sources or articles about digital health by heart? What do you think are the problematic features of the internet?

Greetings :)

> Hey moritz!

Sorry I was very busy that day with my thesis and then forgot to respond. But interesting! See that more and more attention is being paid to this, I have also stopped using instagram and facebook. But I think two effects are the most dangerous. What it does to the self-image of many people, especially the younger ones, is very concerning. Youngsters like my stepsister who spend several hours on Instagram every day looking at the perfect (but distorted) body image and then in the evening look in the mirror and see that they don't look anything like the influencers they follow. Young children under 10 are now also using it, and I am very curious about the harmful consequences.

In addition, I find the most damaging for society as a whole the polarization that this creates. Because of the algorithms of machines, people live in a (dis) information bubble that goes deeper and deeper, as a result of which they live in two parallel worlds and groups become increasingly distant from each other. You can now see this mainly reflected in the conspiracy thinkers and the division of America, the unrest there and the violence used on the street. In the Netherlands too, there is now a large group of people who think extremely about the government and who are already threatening violence.

I think there are enough psychological terms to be found about it, I have never really delved into the literature myself, but this is of course a phenomenon that is getting more and more attention. If I come across something I will forward it to you. The social dilemma is in itself a good documentary that tells in an easy way what the harmful effects are. Good luck and if you have any questions you can always ask them

- Threatened self image through social media consume
- Exposure to children is starting at earlier ages
- Parallel worlds/political polarization through filter bubbles
