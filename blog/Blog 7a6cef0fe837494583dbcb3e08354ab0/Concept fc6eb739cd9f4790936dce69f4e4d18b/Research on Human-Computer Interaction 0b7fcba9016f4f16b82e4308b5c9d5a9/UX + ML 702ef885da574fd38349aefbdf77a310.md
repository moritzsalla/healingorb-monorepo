## Human-centred ML

A guideline for UXers to design AI whilst staying grounded in human needs. The term seems to originates from US  universities. 

> Machine learning (ML)-based AI systems trained with incomplete or distorted data (i.e., their "worldview") can lead to biased "thinking," which may in turn magnify prejudice and inequality, spread rumors and fake news.

AI is to enhance humans rather than replace them

## Human-in-the-loop HITL

Leveraging the power of ML and human collaboration. Humans are directly involved in training, tuning and testing.

> Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid; humans are incredibly slow, inaccurate and brilliant; together they are powerful beyond imagination

In practice, this would mean to use a human crowd to correct inaccuracies within machine predictions, yielding higher quality results.

BigGAN used a large, virtual crowd to curate its data. Is this an example of HITL?

Human interaction with machine learning systems to improve human performance, machine performance, or both

HITL = **supervised machine learning + active learning**

When is this useful?

- No margin of error can be tollerated
- Class imbalances: the desired outcome is niche and cannot be determined with high confidence
- Little data. Ex. a business in its early stages.
